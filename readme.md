## wallcleaner

#### Have you ever been pissed off because of a continuous stream of posts on a Facebook wall which you are not interested in? This Google Chrome extension is designed to ease your pain.

### How does it work?
You can set up your list of words/phrases which appear only in posts that you don't want to see, and then posts which include elements from your list will be hidden from your Facebook wall automatically. The extension remembers your preferences after closing the browser, it also applies the filter on the fly for all posts on your wall, even those that are rendered after some scrolling.

### Installation steps
1. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
2. Select "Developer mode"
3. Drag and drop "wallcleaner.crx" file from this repository to the extensions tab (you may have to refresh the page first to make it work)
4. Click "Add extension"

### Usage
After installing the tool as a Google Chrome extension, you can access its menu by clicking on "W" icon in the extensions panel.
You will see an input field for your first keyword along with "X" button at the right to remove it. Below the first input there is an "Add" button that adds more keyword inputs, and "Save" button which saves the current state of your list and filters the posts.
